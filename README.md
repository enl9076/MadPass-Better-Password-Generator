## MadPass Better Password Generator

##### The goal for this project was to create a simple password generator that does the typical thing of creating strong random passwords but that you could also have some fun with by generating a password using MadLibs-style prompts. 

#### Features:
* 100% offline - no cloud, no sync, everything runs locally, nothing gets saved
* No data collection - nothing is stored, no analytics collected
* Generate strong passwords with custom rules
* Choose length, characters to include or exclude, and complexity
* Copy to clipboard
* Use random words to generate a password
* Create your password Mad-Libs style with a set of random prompts or word categories of your choosing
  
#### Perfect for:
*  Devleopers
*  Privacy-conscious individuals
*  Anyone who reuses "Password123" (I won't judge)


##### This app is currently available in the Microsoft store (https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPDCRDHK2RN84S) and will be available is the Google Play store soon. I am constantly working to improve it and add more features

##### The app is completely free, no in-app purchases, subscriptions, or ads. But if you'd like to support my work so I can continue improving and adding to this and my other apps, please consider supporting me using the button below :)
